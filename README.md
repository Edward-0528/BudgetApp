# MyBudgetApp

A modern, responsive personal budget management application built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. This project showcases my expertise in developing dynamic and visually appealing front-end interfaces, allowing users to efficiently track income and expenses, categorize spending, and visualize financial trends.

## 🚀 Features

  * **Intuitive Dashboard:** A clear overview of your financial status, including total income, expenses, and remaining balance.
  * **Expense Tracking:** Easily add and categorize your expenses.
  * **Income Management:** Record your income sources.
  * **Data Visualization:** (Optional: If you plan to add charts/graphs) Interactive charts and graphs to visualize spending habits and income over time.
  * **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless use across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean and modern design for a smooth user experience.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

  * **[React](https://react.dev/)**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For core application logic.
  * **HTML5**: Structure of the web application.
  * **CSS3**: (Used indirectly through Tailwind CSS, but good to mention for foundational knowledge).
